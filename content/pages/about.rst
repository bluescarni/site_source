About me
########

Hello and welcome, my name is Francesco Biscani and this is my personal website.

I am a postdoctoral researcher in celestial mechanics and dynamical astronomy, currently
at the `Max Planck Institute for Astronomy`_, in Heidelberg (Germany). Previously,
I was a research fellow at the European Space Agency's `Advanced Concepts Team`_ and I served
a brief stint as a high-performance scientific software engineer for `Schlumberger`_.

My `research <{filename}research.rst>`_ focuses around analytical methods for classical and relativistic
celestial mechanics, with an emphasis both on exact solutions and perturbative techniques.

As a part of my scientific activities, I am an active `software <{filename}software.rst>`_ developer. My main project,
`Piranha`_, is a C++ library for the symbolic manipulation of sparse algebraic structures,
such as multivariate polynomials and Poisson series, commonly encountered in celestial mechanics.
